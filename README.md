# CrackTheCourier

Game project for GameHIGHED Jam 2021. Jam's theme was "YOLO".  

Switch between lanes and sidewalk with A and D.
Don't let your yolometer get down to zero by doing dangerous moves such as close calls while passing cars, passing on some cracks on the road, or jumping from ramps. But be careful, some moves make you lose water bottles. As a courier, it's not a thing you would want. If you lose all the water bottles or your yolometer goes down to zero, you lose.
